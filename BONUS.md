A My Bookings page (accessible via route '/bookings/all') which allows the user to see all the booking requests that they have made. Each request is in the form of a card, which displays a thumbnail image of the listing the user has requessted to book, its title, the booking status, as well as the date range and total price of the booking. The user also has the ability to remove this booking request via the 'REMOVE' button.

When searching for a listing using the date range not only does the listing page when you select on it give you the total price over the period (specified in spec) it also prefills in the dates for you allowing you to just click reserve and be on your way! 

In addition all timepickers have their past disabled meaning you cannot choose a date in the past and when choosing to book a listing for a period, you are restricted to only picking dates that are avaliable. Dates that are no available will not be able to be chosen. 

Reserve validation means both the start and the end dates most be filled out in order for the booking to be successfully placed.
