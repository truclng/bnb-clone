Second Happy Path through the program:
- The user successfully registers to AirBrB
- Assuming there are published listings, the user successfuly uses the price filter to search for listings with their desired price range
- Assuming there are matching search results, the user clicks on the first listing to view details about it
- The user successfully books this listing with their desired date range
- The user logs out of AirBrB successfully
- The user logs in successfully
- The user views the listing they last booked

Happy Path justification:
The core usage of AirBnB is for its users to find listings which match their needs and requirements. In this case, our user would like to find a listing which matches the price range which fits their budget, which is why they would be using the price search filter to look for listings which match their requirement. Once matches have been found, it is common for users to view the very first search result, which is what our user will also do in this case. After viewing the listing, the user is happy with it, and decides to book the listing for their desired date range. As the user will need to wait for the owner to process their booking request, they log out of the application. After a while, they log in again to look at the listing they just booked in order to check its booking status. It is common for users to want to know the status of their booking request(s). On our website, the booking status can be viewed by clicking on the listing card from the home page (the card will also say booked on it to remind the user that this is indeed the listing they tried to book) - the booking status is shown at the top of the page next to the listing title.
